  - title: An Eriskay Love Lilt
    composer: Traditional
    transcriber: Marjorie Kennedy-Fraser
    lyricist: Traditional/Rev. Kenneth MacLeod
    arranger: James Shaw
    notes: |
      Thank you all for coming this evening to the Spring Concert of the Edinburgh University Female Voice Choir.
      We are delighted to share with you our work from this semester, which spans the musical spectrum of style and seriousness.

      We started with a Scottish folk song from the Western Isles, 'An Eriskay Love Lilt'.
      It was collected in 'From the Hebrides: Further Gleanings of Tale and Song' in 1925 by the University of Edinburgh-based academic Marjorie Kennedy-Fraser, and the original wax-cylinder recording is still held by the university's Scottish Studies department.
      Kennedy-Fraser wrote the piano accompaniment herself to go with the song she recorded sung by a Mary MacInnes.

      Eriskay is a small island of only three square miles, off the coast of South Uist in the Outer Hebrides.
      A lilt, incidentally, is defined by its use of nonsense syllables, here to sound like Gaelic.

      Fans of Edinburgh University Wind Band's tour repertoire will have recognised it as the second movement from Clare Grundman's 'Hebrides Suite'.
      I have always loved that treatment of the song, and was inspired to make this arrangement as a result.

  - title: Somewhere Only We Know
    composer: Tim Rice-Oxley, Richard Hughes & Tom Chaplin
    arranger: Stuart McSweeney
    notes: |
      We now move on to a piece which is much newer.
      Recorded originally by the band Keane in 2004, and then by Lily Allen in 2013, 'Somewhere Only We Know' describes returning to a place previously well known.
      The precise meaning is unknown, with Keane's drummer saying of it

      > We've been asked whether "Somewhere Only We Know" is about a specific place, and Tim has been saying that, for him, or us as individuals, it might be about a geographical space, or a feeling; it can mean something individual to each person, and they can interpret it to a memory of theirs...
      > It's perhaps more of a theme rather than a specific message...
      > Feelings that may be universal, without necessarily being totally specific to us, or a place, or a time...

      For me, that memory is very specifically of the 16th March 2020, when we, the university clarinet choir, held what turned out to be our last rehearsal before lockdown.
      We recorded the music we'd been preparing for that semester's concert, and this was in it.
      Ever since, when I hear it, it reminds me of feeling of uncertainty and confusion around that time, and the relief when we were able to meet again a year later.
      Others less esoterically associate the song with the 2013 John Lewis Christmas advert.

      Either way, I love this song.

  - title: Your Song
    composer: Elton John & Bernie Taupin
    arranger: Mac Huff
    notes: |
      Elton John, force of nature that he is, wrote the next item in 1970 alongside lyricist Bernie Taupin.
      The lyrics tell of a strightforward love, with occasional non-sequiturs coming from the narrator stumbling over his words.
      It has been covered by artists from Rod Stewart to Ewan McGregor, and features prominently in the film Gnomeo and Juliet.

      This rendition will be less silly, but our gift is our song, and this one's for you.

  - title: So Much Better
    subtitle: "From “Legally Blonde: The Musical”"
    composer: Laurence O'Keefe & Nell Benjamin
    arranger: Mac Huff
    notes: |
      I, entirely unironically, refer to 'Legally Blonde: The Musical' as the most Musical of Musicals.
      It's powerfully Positive.

      There's a phenomenon I find very frustrating in music written for female voice choirs that there's medleys with titles like "GIRL POWER!" which are almost universally full of vacuous love songs written by men.
      This is not that, it's so much better.
      Reviewers saw it and smelt Blood in the Water, referring to it as "a great big empty vessel of a show that makes a lot of noise and not much else, and would have been better entitled 'Irredeemably Bland'", "high-energy, empty-calories, and expensive-looking hymn to the glories of girlishness", and "amorphous, synthetic, and maniacally empty-headed music".
      I don't think they quite understood that that's What You Want from something like this, that art doesn't have to be Serious.
      There's a scene where the entire cast is required to perform a fitness tape while singing and skipping, pausing when the tape is.
      It's utterly exhausting to watch live, but you can't help but be swept along with it.

      'So Much Better' comes at a point where the protagonist has got into Harvard to do law to follow the man who had left her because he thought she wasn't serious enough, and realised that she actually has a knack for it.
      It speaks of building confidence while also being yourself.

      Legally Blonde has just been announced for a revival in London next month in Regent's Park theatre featuring a diverse cast and promises to be every bit as fabulous that the source material requires.
      This evening, we feature Mariam, Freya and Livy as soloists, and we hope we leave you feeling so much better than before.

  - title: Make You Feel My Love
    composer: Bob Dylan
    arranger: Jeremy Birchall & Christopher Hussey
    notes: |
      Folk rock legend Bob Dylan wrote our next song for his 1997 album 'Time Out of Mind', but was beaten to releasing it by Billy Joel.
      Its most famous cover is by Adele on her debut album 19, which she was originally resistant to recording because of the implication that she wasn't able to write enough songs to fill an album.

      Through a jazz-like but laid back chord progression, 'Make You Feel My Love' portrays a caring and emotional love, rooted in the need to make the narrator's affection felt.
      I hope we'll do it justice.

  - title: Bridge Over Troubled Water
    composer: Paul Simon
    arranger: Mark Hayes
    notes: |
      Long-term followers of the choir will know that I took over *temporarily* after the Joint Societies ceilidh in 2020 as they had been left in a bind, having not had a consistent MD since the beginning of the academic year.
      We didn't manage to have that concert, but one of the songs in the programme was this.

      Still here, we're finally performing it, with it bridging the troubled coronavirus waters to our current more stable place.

  - title: Help!
    composer: John Lennon & Paul McCartney
    arranger: Andrew Emmet

    notes: |
      We now end with 'Help!', by the Beatles, featuring our alto section and our treasurer Mariam as soloist.
      Before we do, however, we have some admin to do.
