  - title: The Wellerman
    composer: New Zealand Folksong
    arranger: Roger Emerson

      Thank you all for coming to this, the 2021 Winter Concert of Edinburgh University Female Voice Choir.
      I am delighted to be able to share with you the result of this group's hard work from the last eight weeks after our long hiatus of the last eighteen months.

      Our first piece was The Wellerman, a maritime folk song originally from New Zealand about a whaling ship for the prolific 'Weller Brothers'. 
      2020 came along with many surprises, but one of the greatest of those for me was the sudden surge in the popularity of the sea shanty, or sea song, on TikTok.
      The Wellerman was the one that 'made it', with the version by Glasgow based Nathan Evans and others released early this year reaching number one in UK singles chart.

  - title: Dancing Queen
    composer: Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson
    arranger: Roger Emerson

      Now we go back from 2021 all the way back to 1976. 
      The Summer Olympics were held in Montréal and the winter olympics in Innsbruck, the intercity 125 trains were first run on British rails, the UK and Iceland finally stopped arguing over fishing (for the time being), and the Viking program was on the utopia planitia on Mars - which I genuinely thought was a place made up for Star Trek - giving us colour photos of the surface of Mars for the first time.
      At the same time, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Ebola virus was breaking out for the first time.
      The past, as Douglas Adams put it, is really like a foreign country.
      They do things exactly the same there.

      Also, as it happens, in August 1976, ABBA released the song Dancing Queen.
      To borrow from Wikipedia, it became ABBA's only number one hit in the United States, and topped the charts in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany and what is now Zimbabwe.
      It was so popular, it was performed in 1976 at the pre-wedding gala of King Carl the 16th Gustav of Sweden and his wife-to-be Silvia, and then again at the latter's 50th birthday in 1993.

      In August, the music video was rereleased in 4K, which is an experience in itself.
      Our arrangement is by Roger Emerson.

      Enjoy.
  - title: Fix You
    composer: Guy Berryman, Jon Buckland, Will Champion and Chris Martin
    arranger: Adam Anders and Peter Astrom

      Moving on to 2005, and the album 'X & Y' by Coldplay.
      Unless you've been living under a rock since then, which is a fair thing to do but is fairly unlikely, you'll have heard the song 'Fix You' by Coldplay.

      This arrangement is from the TV show Glee, and features Charlotte Noonan, Catrin Roulston, Mariam Momjian and Helen Wieland as soloists.

      Chris Martin, lead singer of the band, wrote the song to help his then-wife Gwyneth Paltrow process the death of her father, which had happened three weeks before they met.

      This time of year can be hard for many, in the run up to the various winter festivals, as the grief that is usually there in a deep part of you is brought back to the surface by missing people at Christmas events which carry on.
      In my case, we lost a very dear friend of mine in May this year, not to the coronavirus but it was still a complete surprise.
      We lost my dad twenty-four years ago tomorrow to cancer.
      I'm sure others in the choir will have similar experiences.
      Life goes on, as it does for us all, just not quite as brightly as it could do otherwise.

      The song tries to emphasise through lyrics and structure that the pain does ease, even when you lose something that you can't replace. 
      We won't try to fix you, but this might help a bit.
  - title: Do You Hear What I Hear
    composer: Noël Regney and Gloria Shayne
    arranger: Mark Brymer
    notes: |
      Written during the Cuban Missile Crisis, 'Do You Hear What I Hear' mixes various bits of the Christmas story together in a plea for peace about the conflict. The composers, Gloria Shayne-Baker and her then-husband Noël Regney, whose original name Léon Schlienger he reversed when he moved to the US from France having been in the Resistance during the second world war, were originally reticent to write the song due to the increasing commercialisation of Christmas.

      The song was subsequently covered by artists from Perry Como to Johnny Cash, and now by us.
  - title: Silent Night
    composer: Joseph Mohr, John F. Young and Franz X. Gruber
    lyrics: |
      Silent night, holy night!  
      All is calm, all is bright.  
      Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child.  
      Holy infant so tender and mild,  
      Sleep in heavenly peace,  
      Sleep in heavenly peace

      Silent night, holy night!  
      Shepherds quake at the sight.  
      Glories stream from heaven afar  
      Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia,  
      Christ the Savior is born!  
      Christ the Savior is born

      Silent night, holy night!  
      Son of God love's pure light.  
      Radiant beams from Thy holy face  
      With dawn of redeeming grace,  
      Jesus Lord, at Thy birth  
      Jesus Lord, at Thy birth

      To take us into the interval, we now invite you to join in!
      Silent Night was written in 1818 by Franz Xaver Gruber and Joseph Mohr at a church near Salzburg in Austria.
      The church was flooded (quite the feat given how mountainous that area is), and the organ potentially ruined, so it was written for guitar.
      We just have Evie at the piano, but hopefully on this, the second Sunday of Advent, we can help you start getting into the Christmas spirit.

  - title: Bohemian Rhapsody
    composer: Freddie Mercury
    arranger: Mark Brymer
    notes: |

      "Bohemian Rhapsody" is something of a cultural icon. Written for Queen's 1975 album "A Night At The Opera", it is the only song to reach the UK Christmas number one twice by the same artist and is the third bestselling single of all time.

      It was famously very difficult to sing live, due to the recording's heavily multi-tracked nature. It took three weeks to sing originally, battling the technology at the time's ability to only layer twenty-four tracks at once. Given sections contained 180 different layered recordings, the undertaking was immense.

      The song is split into five approximate sections. Firstly, an introduction in a close harmony style, expressing a general sense of nihilistic despair. Then follows a ballad, for us sung by Emily Combs. The third section mimics an operatic style akin to Mozart detailing the narrator's descent into hell, fought over by the likes of Figaro from the Barber of Seville and Gallileo Galilei. 
      The fourth section is best known outside of its original context as the headbanging section from the film "Wayne's World", and then it ends back where it started, in close harmony but somewhat different from before.

      This year marks the 30th anniversary of Freddie Mercury's death, and we hope that we can do this, one of his many master works, the justice it deserves.

  - title: How Far I'll Go
    composer: Lin-Manuel Miranda
    arranger: Ed Lojeski
    notes: |
      The 2016 Disney film Moana explores the traditions of a pacific island culture through the lens of the sixteen-year old daughter of the chief of the island. She learns of her people's sea-faring ancestry and feels drawn in two directions - towards her home and family, and out onto the water. 
      The music and lyrics are written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who claims that he went 'full method' when writing the score to get into the mind of the character, barricading himself in his childhood bedroom.
      "How Far I'll Go" expresses Moana's need to explore, and find herself, tempered by the ties that bind her to her home.
  - title: I'll Be Home For Christmas
    composer: Kim Gannon and Walter Kent
    arranger: Ed Lojeski
    notes: |
      I spent Christmas Day 2021 here in Edinburgh, the first time in my life not surrounded by family in some way.
      I hadn't actually planned to go home, given the way the wind was blowing, and the exploding coronavirus case numbers, but it was still a difficult decision to make.
      We played a board game remotely over a video call while either side cooked separate lunches.
      My mother, ever supportive, acted horrified that I asked for advice on how to make a Yorkshire pudding.
      A friend, who had been stranded here by safety concerns around the alpha variant, came round to eat.

      It was Christmas, complete with (virtual) midnight mass courtesy of Marchmont St Giles, family board games and more food than was perhaps reasonable.
      It just felt... wrong.

      With many similarly forced to spend the festive period far from home and the usual activities by circumstance, it's perhaps unsurprising that "I'll Be Home For Christmas" managed to chart again in the US in January 2021.
      Its melancholy tone of wishing to be home, surrounded by all the regular trappings, resonated unexpectedly with the developing situation around the 2020 Christmas period.

      "I'll Be Home For Christmas" was originally written to honour American soldiers fighting abroad in 1943, and was Bing Crosby's fifth gold record. It was banned by the BBC from broadcast, worrying that it might lower morale.

      Hopefully, this year, being where we want to be over the end of year festivals won't only be in our dreams.

    title: Do They Know It's Christmas
    composer: Bob Geldof and Midge Ure
    lyrics: |
      It's Christmas time  
      There's no need to be afraid  
      At Christmas time  
      We let in light and we banish shade

      And in our world of plenty  
      We can spread a smile of joy  
      Throw your arms around the world  
      At Christmas time

      But say a prayer  
      Pray for the other ones  
      At Christmas time  
      It's hard, but when you're having fun

      There's a world outside your window  
      And it's a world of dread and fear  
      Where the only water flowing  
      Is the bitter sting of tears

      And the Christmas bells that ring there  
      Are the clanging chimes of doom  
      Well, tonight thank God it's them  
      Instead of you

      And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time  
      The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (oh)  
      Where nothing ever grows, no rain nor rivers flow  
      Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

      (Here's to you) Raise a glass for everyone  
      (Here's to them) Underneath that burning sun  
      Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

      Feed the world  
      Let them know it's Christmas time again (x3)
