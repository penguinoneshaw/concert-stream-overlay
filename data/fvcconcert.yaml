    lyrics: |     
      Silent night, holy night!  
      All is calm, all is bright.  
      Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child.  
      Holy infant so tender and mild,  
      Sleep in heavenly peace,  
      Sleep in heavenly peace

      Silent night, holy night!  
      Shepherds quake at the sight.  
      Glories stream from heaven afar  
      Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia,  
      Christ the Savior is born!  
      Christ the Savior is born

      Silent night, holy night!  
      Son of God love's pure light.  
      Radiant beams from Thy holy face  
      With dawn of redeeming grace,  
      Jesus Lord, at Thy birth  
      Jesus Lord, at Thy birth

    title: Do They Know It's Christmas
    composer: Bob Geldof and Midge Ure
    lyrics: |
      It's Christmas time  
      There's no need to be afraid  
      At Christmas time  
      We let in light and we banish shade

      And in our world of plenty  
      We can spread a smile of joy  
      Throw your arms around the world  
      At Christmas time

      But say a prayer  
      Pray for the other ones  
      At Christmas time  
      It's hard, but when you're having fun

      There's a world outside your window  
      And it's a world of dread and fear  
      Where the only water flowing  
      Is the bitter sting of tears

      And the Christmas bells that ring there  
      Are the clanging chimes of doom  
      Well, tonight thank God it's them  
      Instead of you

      And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time  
      The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (oh)  
      Where nothing ever grows, no rain nor rivers flow  
      Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

      (Here's to you) Raise a glass for everyone  
      (Here's to them) Underneath that burning sun  
      Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

      Feed the world  
      Let them know it's Christmas time again (x3)
